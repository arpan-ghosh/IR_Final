## Overview
The United States election of 2016 ushered in a new era of politics for the United States, but it also shocked the world, particularly for those in the field of predictive analytics. Almost every major polling site predicted between an 80% to over 99% landslide victory for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (fig. 1), and others predicted a Clinton victory even if the margins weren't as high. Yet the reality on November 9th were electoral results that were very far from the predictions. Particularly, states that were unilaterally predicted to go blue for Hillary, that ultimately cost her the election, went to Trump in a decisive electoral victory (i.e. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and the wild-cards North Carolina and Florida). The predictive analytic business relies heavily on quantitative data, as qualitative data is hard enough to decipher. Major media outlets and the most trusted polling organizations suffered a significant embarrassment, and the question that went through the minds of everyone in the business of predictive and accurate data analytics were whether conventional polling mechanisms were still accurate, or was a landslide Trump victory truly a statistical anomaly?
